# Dice-Roll-Experiment
Jupyter Notebook experiment to show my friend that rolling at least one 6 in 3 rolls only has a chance of roughly 42% of happening not 50% like they assumed. This is because each time you have a 1 in 6 chance of rolling a 6. Two ways to prove this mathematically are 1 - (5/6) or (5/6)^2*(1/6)*3 + (5/6)*(1/6)^2*3 + (1/6)^3. The second way is the probability of exactly 1 6 rolled plus the probability of exactly 2 sixes rolled plus the probability of exactly 3 sixes rolled.
